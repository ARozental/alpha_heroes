# joint7 (2026-10-31 night): the campaign model from its imitation of Nullkiller2 (runtime/saved/campaign_imitation.pt),
# self-play RL with Nullkiller2's own advice as the teacher (20% of turn decisions: Advice.cpp; its cross-entropy weighted
# by our score against it, teacher_mix "score": dominant while it is much better), the credit's share weight 10% + 2% a
# day, the battle model from joint5's best (7295, trained on); the PC alone (16 games, one CUDA inference server for both
# models), no time limit, the memory guard on.
